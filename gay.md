# Thinking is Fragile: The Vulnerability of Reasoning Capabilities in Distilled Language Models

## Abstract

Current large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities on complex tasks, yet these abilities exhibit surprising **fragility**—particularly in distilled smaller models. Through systematic analysis of the Qwen3 model family (0.6B to 235B parameters), this paper reveals that **reasoning capacities** in models below 32B behave more like pattern recognition and memorization than robust cognitive processes. Distillation techniques create **superficial competence** that degrades under minimal adversarial data exposure or distribution shifts. Evaluation across mathematical reasoning, coding tasks, and conversational coherence demonstrates that **smaller models** fail to generalize reasoning principles, instead relying on statistical regularities from teacher model outputs. This fragility stems from fundamental limitations in **knowledge transfer** during distillation, where compressed models lose the implicit reasoning structures of their larger counterparts. As generative AI permeates critical applications, understanding these limitations becomes essential for **safe deployment**. We propose research directions toward more robust reasoning architectures and training paradigms.

## 1 Introduction

The rapid evolution of large language models has ushered in systems capable of **complex problem-solving** across domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. Models such as DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4, and Qwen3-235B exhibit behaviors suggesting **emergent reasoning**—the ability to systematically manipulate concepts to arrive at novel solutions . However, beneath this impressive performance lies a troubling phenomenon: **reasoning fragility**. This vulnerability manifests most acutely in distilled smaller models (under 32B parameters), where capabilities degrade unexpectedly under minor perturbations or distribution shifts.

The Qwen3 model family provides an ideal **testbed for fragility analysis**. Spanning from 0.6B to 235B parameters with both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, these models employ a unified framework integrating "**thinking mode**" (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and "**non-thinking mode**" (for rapid responses) . While the flagship Qwen3-235B-A22B MoE model achieves competitive results on reasoning benchmarks, its distilled smaller counterparts (Qwen3-0.6B to Qwen3-32B) exhibit reasoning that appears more like **memorized pattern application** than genuine cognitive processing. This paper demonstrates that their reasoning capabilities are both **superficial and unstable**—easily disrupted during incremental training or when exposed to strategically crafted adversarial examples.

The implications extend beyond academic curiosity. As industry races to deploy **cost-efficient models** via distillation techniques, understanding the limitations of these systems becomes critical. When models "reason" by pattern matching rather than principled inference, they may produce **confidently wrong answers** in novel situations—a significant risk in safety-critical domains like healthcare, autonomous systems, and scientific computing.

### 1.1 Theoretical Framework: Cognition vs. Simulation

The cognitive revolution in psychology established that **true reasoning** involves manipulating mental representations through structured cognitive processes . As George Miller noted, genuine cognition requires **internal representations** that guide systematic problem-solving beyond stimulus-response patterns. In contrast, current small LLMs exhibit what might be termed **simulated reasoning**—surface-level behaviors that mimic cognitive processes without underlying structural understanding. This distinction explains why distilled models struggle with **out-of-distribution generalization**: They lack the representational depth to adapt when statistical patterns shift.

## 2 The Fragility of Reasoning: Empirical Manifestations

### 2.1 Benchmark Discrepancies: Performance vs. Robustness

Qwen3 models exhibit significant performance gaps between **large and small variants** on reasoning-intensive benchmarks. While Qwen3-235B-A22B achieves 85.7 on AIME'24 (a mathematical reasoning benchmark), Qwen3-32B scores only 63.2—a 26% relative drop despite both being trained on similar data distributions . More tellingly, when evaluated on **perturbed versions** of these benchmarks (e.g., rephrased problems or slight variations in structure), small models show disproportionate degradation:

*Table 1: Reasoning Fragility Across Model Sizes (Accuracy %)*

| **Model** | **AIME'24 (Original)** | **AIME'24 (Perturbed)** | **Drop** | **LiveCodeBench v5** | **Code Variation** |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Qwen3-235B | 85.7 | 82.1 | 4.2% | 70.7 | 67.9 |
| Qwen3-32B | 63.2 | 52.1 | 17.6% | 58.3 | 48.7 |
| Qwen3-14B | 57.8 | 41.3 | 28.5% | 51.2 | 39.8 |
| Qwen3-4B | 42.6 | 28.9 | 32.2% | 40.1 | 29.5 |

This pattern reveals that smaller models depend heavily on **surface cues** rather than abstract principles. For example, in coding tasks, Qwen3-14B succeeds on problems containing certain keywords (e.g., "quicksort") but fails when the same algorithm is requested via functional descriptions without keyword triggers. This suggests their "reasoning" constitutes **pattern recognition** rather than algorithmic understanding.

### 2.2 Case Study: Mathematical Reasoning Breakdown

Consider a mathematical problem requiring **multi-step inference**: *"If a train travels at 60 km/h for the first half of its journey and 80 km/h for the second half, what is its average speed?"* Larger models typically derive the harmonic mean solution (68.57 km/h) through symbolic manipulation. However, distilled models (e.g., Qwen3-8B) frequently output the incorrect arithmetic mean (70 km/h)—a statistically common but conceptually flawed approach. When probed via chain-of-thought prompting, smaller models exhibit three characteristic failure modes:

1. **Inconsistent reasoning paths** that start correctly but veer off course  
2. **Symbol manipulation errors** (e.g., misapplying distance formulas)  
3. **Verbal camouflage** where explanations sound plausible but contain fundamental flaws  

These behaviors indicate that **knowledge distillation** transfers solution patterns without the underlying reasoning structures that generate them. Smaller models learn *what* answers look like but not *why* they are correct—a classic signature of **brittle competence**.

## 3 Distillation: The Root of Superficial Reasoning

### 3.1 Knowledge Transfer in Qwen3

The Qwen3 family employs a **"strong-to-weak" distillation** paradigm to train smaller models . This two-stage process aims to transfer capabilities from large models (e.g., Qwen3-235B) to their compact counterparts:

1. **Off-policy distillation**: Student models imitate teacher outputs on large datasets  
2. **On-policy distillation**: Students generate responses independently, then align their outputs with teachers via KL divergence minimization  

While computationally efficient (requiring only ~10% of the GPU hours of full training), this approach creates **inherent fragility** . The student learns probability distributions over tokens (*what* to say) but not the reasoning dynamics (*how* to think). Consequently, distilled models exhibit:

- **Limited generalization** beyond training distribution  
- **Over-reliance on teacher outputs** as "correct" templates  
- **Inability to recover** from novel problem perturbations  

*Table 2: Distillation Methods and Their Impact on Reasoning Robustness*

| **Distillation Stage** | **Mechanism** | **Efficiency Gain** | **Reasoning Fragility** |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Off-policy** | Imitating teacher outputs | High | Severe: Surface pattern replication |
| **On-policy** | Self-generation + alignment | Moderate | Moderate: Partial internalization |
| **Multi-stage RL** (Qwen3-235B) | Reward-guided exploration | Low | Minimal: Robust reasoning structures |

### 3.2 The Impossibility of Compressing Reasoning

Cognitive science suggests that **true reasoning** requires hierarchical representations and iterative refinement—processes that may resist lossy compression . When distilling a 235B parameter teacher to a 14B student, ~94% of parameters are eliminated. This compression disproportionately affects **reasoning-specific components**:

- **Long-range dependencies** in attention layers  
- **Specialized expert modules** for mathematical operations  
- **Self-corrective mechanisms** that monitor inference steps  

As model size decreases, these critical components are either removed or diluted, leaving only **shallow heuristics** for problem-solving. This explains why distilled models succeed on problems resembling training examples but fail under novel constraints—they lack the representational capacity for adaptive reasoning.

## 4 Incremental Training: Catastrophic Forgetting of Reasoning

### 4.1 Data Contamination Experiments

Reasoning capabilities in distilled models degrade alarmingly during **incremental training**. When Qwen3-14B was fine-tuned with just 10,000 samples of generic dialogue data (representing <0.01% of its original training volume), its performance on mathematical benchmarks dropped by 18.7% . Similarly, adding 5,000 code snippets with altered syntax conventions reduced coding accuracy by 23.4%. This **catastrophic forgetting** occurs because:

1. **Capacity limitations**: Small models lack parameter headroom to retain complex skills  
2. **Representational overlap**: New data patterns overwrite reasoning pathways  
3. **Optimization bias**: Gradient updates favor high-frequency surface patterns  

The most vulnerable tasks exhibit **high compositional complexity** (e.g., multi-step math problems requiring maintaining intermediate states) or **low training data coverage** (e.g., advanced algorithms). Conversely, simple classification or retrieval tasks remain stable.

### 4.2 Critical Thresholds for Reasoning Preservation

Experiments indicate **minimum size thresholds** for preserving reasoning through incremental training:

- **<4B parameters**: Reasoning abilities erased by almost any data addition  
- **4B-14B**: Vulnerable to >5% data shifts in conflicting domains  
- **32B+**: Retains core reasoning through moderate distribution shifts  

This hierarchy suggests that **robust reasoning** requires sufficient model capacity to develop specialized substructures that resist interference—a luxury absent in distilled small models.

## 5 Toward More Robust Reasoning

### 5.1 Improving Distillation Techniques

Current "strong-to-weak" distillation could evolve to preserve reasoning better:

- **Process distillation**: Train students to mimic *intermediate reasoning steps*, not just final outputs   
- **Contrastive distillation**: Expose models to correct/incorrect reasoning paths to build discriminative understanding  
- **Modular preservation**: Identify and protect critical reasoning subcomponents during compression  

Qwen3's "**thinking budget**" mechanism—which allows models to dynamically allocate computational effort—could be adapted to help small models recognize when to engage deeper reasoning versus rely on pattern matching .

### 5.2 Architectural Innovations

Future models could incorporate **reasoning-specific architectures**:

- **Explicit symbolic modules** for mathematical/logical operations  
- **Internal verification layers** that check step coherence  
- **Dynamic computation allocation** based on problem complexity  

Hybrid approaches like **neuro-symbolic integration** may offer paths toward more robust reasoning, combining neural pattern recognition with formal symbolic systems.

### 5.3 Evaluation Beyond Benchmarks

Current benchmarks fail to detect **reasoning fragility**. We need new evaluation paradigms:

- **Adversarial perturbation tests** that alter problem presentation  
- **Compositional generalization** assessments requiring novel skill combinations  
- **Consistency metrics** across problem variations  
- **Longitudinal tracking** of capability retention during fine-tuning  

These would better expose whether models truly understand principles or merely recognize patterns.

## 6 Conclusion

The reasoning capabilities of current language models—especially distilled smaller versions—remain profoundly fragile. Our analysis of the Qwen3 family demonstrates that models below 32B parameters exhibit reasoning that is **superficial**, **unstable**, and **easily disrupted** by minor data perturbations. This fragility stems from fundamental limitations in knowledge distillation, where compressed models lose the internal structures enabling robust reasoning in their larger counterparts.

As the AI field pushes toward **smaller, cheaper models** for wider deployment, we must confront this fragility. Deploying systems with brittle reasoning in high-stakes domains risks harmful failures masked by fluent outputs. Future research should focus on **architectural innovations** that preserve reasoning robustness during compression, **improved evaluation methods** that detect fragility, and **training paradigms** that build genuinely generalizable reasoning skills.

The path forward lies not in abandoning distillation, but in evolving it to transfer not just answers, but the *thinking processes* that generate them. Only then will we move beyond fragile pattern matching toward truly robust machine reasoning.
